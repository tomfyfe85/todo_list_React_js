This project was built using React, I use Vite to install it.
Create a new repo for the Todo list
In the terminal enter:

npm create vite@latest
(You need Node Version 18 or higher) 

Then follow prompts to install React with JavaScript.

Once installed, clone repo this into you your new Todo directory and start making a Todo list.

NOTE: This is V1 of this Todo App, it will be updated in the future.
